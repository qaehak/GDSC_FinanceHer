# GDSC Build With AI Mac-A-Thon: FinanceHer

## Inspiration ‚ú®
_The lack of accessible financial tools for women exacerbates poverty and inequality, perpetuating cycles of economic disadvantage_. **FinanceHer** was created to bridge this gap, empowering women with the tools to make informed financial decisions and achieve financial independence. By offering clear financial insights, tracking, and personalized education, FinanceHer helps users build confidence in managing their finances!

## What it does üöÄ
FinanceHer was designed to simplify financial management and improve users' financial literacy. The website offers several key features, including an OCR receipt scanning tool that uses AI to extract spending details from uploaded receipts. It also categorizes expenses into categories to offer users a clear picture of their spending patterns. Visualizations like pie charts and bar graphs are also included to help users track their expenses and understand their financial habits. Additionally, FinanceHer offers personalized financial advice through an AI-powered chatbot that analyzes spending and provides actionable tips for better money management. Overall, FinanceHer serves as an educational platform, giving users personalized guidance on budgeting, saving, investing, and more.

## How we built it üöß
FinanceHer was built using Python and Google‚Äôs Gemini API, along with cloud technologies to enable the app's main features. The core of the platform relies on OCR processing, where Google‚Äôs Gemini API is used to extract text from receipt images. I also developed a categorization algorithm that automatically assigns purchases to relevant categories based on keywords found in the receipt. The app‚Äôs visualization tools were created with Matplotlib, generating pie charts and bar graphs to provide an intuitive understanding of spending patterns. Additionally, FinanceHer utilizes Google Gemini to offer personalized financial advice, delivered via a chatbot-style interface to users. This enables a dynamic and engaging user experience when helping users manage their financial health.

## Challenges we ran into üåâ
- **Time Constraints**: The limited time made it difficult to implement all features, especially integrating the front-end with the back-end. This also meant I couldn't polish every detail of the app as much as I would have liked.
- **First-Time Use of AI**: Another challenge was my first-time use of AI and Google APIs, which required me to learn and adapt quickly. Implementing AI-driven solutions like OCR and natural language processing presented some learning curves.
- **Interface Design**: Finally, crafting an interface that is intuitive and user-friendly for a diverse audience posed another challenge, especially since the app aims to cater to women with varying degrees of financial literacy.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of üôå
Despite the challenges, I am proud of several key accomplishments. First and foremost, I successfully integrated OCR technology using Google‚Äôs Gemini API, which enabled the application to extract data from receipt images accurately. I also developed a categorization system that can automatically assign purchases to categories, giving users a comprehensive view of their spending. Another accomplishment I am proud of is the personalized financial advice offered by the app‚Äôs chatbot, which gives actionable, user-specific recommendations based on user's spending patterns. The data visualizations, including pie charts and bar graphs, are another feature I'm proud of, as they help users better understand their financial data in a clear, visually appealing way. Finally, I am pleased to have built a platform that empowers women by providing the tools and education needed to confidently manage their finances.

## What we learned üéì
I learned a great deal about AI integration and how machine learning models like Google‚Äôs Gemini API can be applied to solve real-world problems. Additionally, the development of FinanceHer taught me how advanced technologies can enhance financial decision-making and provide actionable advice to help individuals break economic cycles and become financially literate.

## What's next for FinanceHer ‚è≠Ô∏è
- **Improving the Chatbot**: I plan to expand and train the AI on more diverse financial data sets to improve its advice generation capabilities
- **Connecting Front-End and Back-End**: Fully integrating the user interface with back-end systems for a complete and seamless experience.
- **Implementing Data Security**: Prioritize better encryption and secure data storage practices to ensure user privacy.
- **Expanding and Improving Features**: Add tools like data storage, budgeting calculators, savings goals, and investment tracking to further support users in managing their finances.
